# X-Plane.org Plugin Manager

Get the add-on from the [Mozilla add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/x-plane-plugin-manager/).

Having a lot of X-Plane addons can be confusing sometimes and hard to manage. This plugin-manager allows you to add plugins from [forums.x-plane](https://forums.x-plane.org/) into a popup, where crucial plugin information as the name, installed version and current version will be shown.  This creates a simple overview over all plugins and informs users of new updates of added plugins.

This Add-on is still work in progress and currently **only** works in Firefox and Chrome.

Please report any bugs or issues [here](https://github.com/Mikerosoft25/x-plane.org-plugin-manager/issues).
